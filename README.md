# Model Training and Testing

## Setting up local environment

Since certain pip packages didn't work at the time of working on our project we were required to use an older version of Python. For this reason using a venv is recommended as it's easier to enforce the used Python version.

```bash
python3.9 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

Then install all the required pip packages into the venv and you should be good to go.
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
